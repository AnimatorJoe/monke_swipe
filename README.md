# Monke Swipe
This one night, I spent 20 minutes swiping on Tinder like a monke, and figured "why can't I have a bot that does this manual labor for me?" So here it is, the Monke Swipe bot.

## Setting Up the Runtime

### Webdriver

To run the project, first make sure you have the Chromium Web Driver [installed](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).

For Mac OS, make sure the executable is moved to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Dependencies

Install whatever is in the requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt` either globally or in a virtualenv (recommended).
